    "In this exercise, you will use the **Diabetes dataset** (built into scikit-learn) to explore how **Ridge** and **Lasso regression** handle correlated predictors and the effects of regularization. You will compare them to a standard **Linear Regression** model, visualize their coefficients, and interpret how regularization influences **model complexity** and **performance**.\n",
