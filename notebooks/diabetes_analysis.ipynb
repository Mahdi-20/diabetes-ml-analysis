    "In this exercise, you will use the **Diabetes dataset** (built into scikit-learn) to explore how **Ridge** and **Lasso regression** handle correlated predictors and the effects of regularization. You will compare them to a standard **Linear Regression** model, visualize their coefficients, and interpret how regularization influences **model complexity** and **performance**.\n",

    "- Apply **Ridge** and **Lasso regression** to control model complexity and prevent overfitting.  \n",
    "- Use **cross-validation** to select the optimal level of regularization (`alpha`).  \n",
    "- Interpret how regularization affects **coefficient magnitude**, **sparsity**, and **model interpretability**.  \n",
    "- Evaluate how adding **interaction features** changes model bias, variance, and predictive performance."
